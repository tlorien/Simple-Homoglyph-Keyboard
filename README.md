# Simple Homoglyph Keyboard
<img alt="Logo" src="graphics/icon.png" width="120" />

A lightweight keyboard app with homoglyph character replacement and with enhancements for pseudo-privacy. The app supports multiple languages and layouts, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs. The keyboard operates without internet access, ensuring greater privacy, security, and stability compared to other keyboard apps.

Unique to this app are features that help protect against AI and machine learning analysis:

**Homoglyphics Toggle**: Switch on to replace characters with visually similar alternatives, adding an extra layer of obfuscation.
**Noise Toggle**: Activate to intermittently introduce random noise, such as invisible characters and random characters and case variations. This subtly disrupts pattern recognition technologies without drastically affecting readability.

Contains no ads or unnecessary permissions. It is fully opensource, provides customizable colors.
